    Problem 1 [15/15]
        [4 points] fdump accepts command line parameters.  
        [6 points] fdump reads the file correctly.
        [5 points] fdump calls hexdump function to produce an output.

    Problem 2 [15/15]
        [4 points] 2.1: Run your fdump program with the following parameters: filename = hexdump.c, 
                        offset=1000, size=128. Explain what you see.
        [4 points] 2.2: Run your fdump program with the following parameters: filename = fdump, 
                        offset=500, size=128. Explain what you see.
        [4 points] 2.3: Compare the output you produced for answers (2.1) and (2.2). 
                        Looking at the hexadecimal dump on the left, in both cases, makes it clear 
                        that inside both files, you store information in binary encoding. However, 
                        the data to the right of the hexadecimal dump shows something human-readable 
                        for (2.1) and non-human readable for (2.2). In this answer, you are asked to 
                        explain why this is the case.
        [3 points] 2.4: Explain how file(1) works.
        

Lab: 70/70
    Problem 1 [20/20] file_stat prints the following.
        [3 points] File system block size
        [2 points] Maximum file name length
        [2 points] File protection string
        [2 points] File protection mode
        [2 points] Owner user name
        [2 points] Owner group name
        [3 points] mode (file, link directory, socket etc.)
        [2 points] Time of last access
        [2 points] Time of last status change

    Problem 2 [20/20]
        2.1: Combine file_stat.c with read_dir.c to create traverse.c that prints:
            [4 points] The value of the smallest, the largest, and the average file size.
            [4 points] Total number of directories.
            [4 points] Total number of regular files.
            [4 points] The name of the file that was most recently modified, and the one that was least recently modified in the directory tree.
        [4 points] 2.2 & 2.3: Modify the code so that the symbolic link is not traversed as a directory.


    Problem 3 [8/8] answers.txt
        [2 points] 3.1: Provide an example of an operation on a regular file which changes only its time of last status change.
        [2 points] 3.2: Provide an example of an operation on a regular file which changes its time of modification.
        [2 points] 3.3: Provide an example of an operation on a regular file which changes its time of last access.
        [2 points] 3.4: Provide an example of an application where knowing the maximum file name length is helpful. 
                        In this item, you can simply describe a scenario in which a given program needs to have the maximum length of file names.

    Problem 4 [22/22]
        [11 points] sender.c works properly.
        [11 points] receiver.c works properly.

Grade: 100/100
