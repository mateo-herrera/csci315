Lab 1 -- Feedback
------------------------------------------------------------

Prelab: 0/30 - 0% for being >3 days late
	Problem 1 [10/10]
		[4 points] Program reads in four command line arguments of types char, int, float, and string.
		[2 points] Program terminates with an error message if fewer than four or more than four command line arguments are provided.
		[4 points] Program prints to the terminal all the four command line arguments provided.

	Problem 2 [10/10]
		[2 points] Program reads in one command line argument of type string.
		[2 points] Program terminates if fewer than one or more than one command line argument is provided.
		[6 points] Program prints to the terminal the correct reversal of the string provided as command line argument.
		[3 points, partial credit] Program prints to the terminal characters that were not part of the original string.

	Problem 3 [10/10]
		[5 points] Program creates two children process with the same parent.
		[3 points] Each of the three processes (parent, first child, and second child) runs on an infinite loop that prints their identification and an integer value to the terminal.
		[2 points] Each of the three processes (parent, first child, and second child) maintains its own integer counter independently of the other processes.

Lab: 44.8/70 - 30% deduction for being <3 days late
	Problem 0 [5/5]
		Submitted a Makefile that builds all the programs created or modified for the prelab and lab.

	Problem 1 [20/20]
		[5 points] Added to fork.c code to have both child and parent print out the value of the pid returned by the fork system call.
				   fork.c must compile and execute correctly, otherwise scores only 2 points.
		[5 points] Submitted file answers.txt explains whether there is one instance of variable num for the two processes
				   or if there is an instance in the memory space of the parent process and another instance in the memory of the child process.
		[7 points] Submitted file fork-wait.c demonstrates the use of wait or waitpid by making the parent process wait for the child to terminate before itself can terminate.
		[3 points] Submitted file fork-wait.c has the child process making calls to getpid and getppid to obtain and print its pid and its parent’s pid.

	Problem 2 [25/25]
		[4 points] Submitted file answers.txt explains which segment (text, data, heap, or stack) contains the variables pid, x, y, i, and j declared in file fork-data.c.
		[5 points] Submitted file answers.txt explains whether the data segment and the stack segment of the parent process are copied over to the child process (2 points)
				   and whether changes the child makes to its variables can be seen by the parent process (3 points).
		[6 points] Submitted file fork-file.c used the file descriptor Linux API to create a file called data.txt and to write into it the given string.
		[6 points] Submitted file answers.txt explains if a file closed by one of the processes can be read by the other (3 points)
				   and if the child reading from the file affects the reads the parent makes to the same file (3 points).
		[4 points] Submitted file fork-file.c contains wrapper Fork() that calls fork(), checks if the returned value was -1 calling perror to print a message to the terminal
				   indicating the error that happened and later aborting the program with return code -1.

	Problem 3 [14/20] - execlp should run using /bin/cat and /usr/bin/wc
		[10 points] In submitted file catcount.c, the child process successfully calls execlp to run /bin/cat with the argument received from the command line (4 points);
					the parent process calls wait to block until the child’s terminates passing a return code to indicate its termination status (2 points);
					if the first child terminates without error, the parent spawns another child and waits for its termination (2 points);
					the new child calls execlp to run /usr/bin/wc on the file name the parent received its command line (2 points).
		[10 points] Submitted file catcount.c implements function print_environment that compiles without warnings (5 points);
					the execution of that function produces output similar to that of program env(1) (5 points).


Grade: 44.8/100
Comment: Good work! Don't forget to include prelab files in Makefile and make clean before pushing.
