Lab 2 -- Feedback

Prelab: 0/30 - 0% for being >3 days late
	Problem 1 [0/15]
    	[2 points] Submitted program heap-test.c.
    	[3 points] Program compiles without warnings or errors.
    	[5 points] Program allocates something on the heap and spawns a child process.
	    [5 points] Program prints to the terminal the contents of the dynamically allocated memory in the parent and in the child process.

	Problem 2 [0/15]
    	[6 points] Submitted program pipe-test.c with the contents of figure “Ordinary Pipe in UNIX” from SGG, which compiles
        	       without warnings or errors and executes without crashing.
    	[3 points] Submitted file answers-prelab.txt describes what can be observed in the experiment in Problem 1
    	           (sharing of heap data between parent and child processes).
	  	[3 points] Submitted file answers-prelab.txt explains how parent and child processes can have access to the pipe file descriptor created by the parent.
    	[3 points] Submitted file answers-prelab.txt explains how similar (or dissimilar) is the API that Unix provides for working with files and pipes.

If no working Makefile is provided, subtract [10 points] from the total grade of the prelab.

Lab: 63/70 - 10% deduction for being <1 day late
    Problem 1 [30/30]
		[30 points] Using the Fork wrapper example in Lab 1, write three additional ones, pipe(), read(), and write(), 10 points for each of the functions.
					You must implement the correct functionality for sending and receiving messages byte-by-byte over the pipe using these wrapper functions.

	Problem 2 [20/20]
		[10 points] Using the wrappers defined previously, set up the pipes between the child and parent properly so the communication between
					the parent and the child is bi-directional.
		[5 points] The parent writes a string of arbitrary length to the child one byte at a time, then enters a loop, reading what the child sends back.
				   Note that the parent must send the child a NULL character (‘\0’) to end the string.
		[5 points] The child process, receiving the string of unknown length ending with a ‘\0’, converts everything into upper case using the C toupper(3)
				   function, returns the string back to the parent through the pipe.

	Probem 3 [20/20]
		[10 points] Implement the sending/receiving protocol properly, that is, always send an integer representing the number of incoming bytes first,
					followed by the actual string of that length. The receiver will expect an integer first, followed by a string of
					the length specified by the integer.
		[10 points] Properly tokenize on the child’s side, removing extra blank spaces, then send the processed string back to the parent.
					Note: the following was added after the original posting. Use functions strtok() and strcat() properly, 3 points will be taken
						  off if one of these functions is not used. 6 points off for neither.

Grade: 63/100
Comment: Good work!
