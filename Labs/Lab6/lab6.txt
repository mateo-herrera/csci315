1.1
    When I run my program it works as intened with no neighboring philosophers eating at the same time.

1.2
    The program could deadlock if 1,3, & 5 are eating or if 0,2, & 4 are eating as the neighboring philosophers would be unable to start eating.

2.2
    napping 0-2 seconds after the first chopstick was picked up using the mutex lock causes for a deadlock to eventually occur as each philosopher picks up there first chopstick and waits indefinetly for the second.

3.1
    the first solution reduces deadlocking greatly but its still possible to enter a circular wait loop, and the second solution eleminates deadlocking but can result in starvation, where one chopstick is used more than others.
