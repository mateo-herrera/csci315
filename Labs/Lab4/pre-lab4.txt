Problem 1:
    For all 3 of the commands upon success zero is returned, but if an error arises -1 is returned. For read and socket the file descriptor is returned by a successful call will be the lowest-numbered file descriptor not currently open for the process. All 3 of the functions are communication methods as well.

Probelm 2:
    1. The client uses the servers IP adress to connect to the server allowing for communication, while the server uses a while loop to recieve the connection from the client.
    2. Bind assigns the IP/ port number to the socket where the connection comess from, used in server.
    3. Connect allows for the connection of the socket to the adress specificed, used in client.
    4. Listen is used by the server to set up the socekt to recieve incoming client connections.
    5. Accept extracts the first connection request on the queue of connections pending from the listening socket on the server.
    6. The send, sendtom and sendmsg system calls will be used to transit message to other sockets. The recv, recvfrom, and recvmsg call will be used to recieve message from a socket.
